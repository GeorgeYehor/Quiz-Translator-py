# Quiz-Translator-py
Program for learning foreign languages
This is a program that allows users to input words and their translations, and then tests the user on translations by showing a randomly selected word and asking for its translation. The words and translations are stored in a dictionary and also recorded in a file called "Dictionary.txt". The program continues to test the user until the user exits the program by pressing "x" and then "ENTER".
